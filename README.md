# The project specifications
Your website must meet the following requirements.
- **Pages.** You website should have at least three pages: one for Google Search, one for Google Image Search, and one for Google Advanced Search. 
     - On the Google Search page, there should be links in the upper-right of the page to go to Image Search or Advanced Search. On each of the other two pages, there should be a link in the upper-right to go back to Google Search. 
- **Query text**. On the Google Search page, the user should be able to type in a query, click "google Search", and be taken to the Google search results for that page.
     - Like Google's own, your search bar should be centred with rounded corners. The search button should also be centred, and should be beneath the search bar. 
- **Query images**. On the Google Image Search page, the user should be able to type in a query, click a search button, and be taken to the Google Image search results for that page.
